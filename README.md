*Class Prompt:* What kind of scientist do you tell people you are at dinner parties?

*Response:* Honestly, I don't call myself a scientist yet. I feel that I need to "earn" that name. _If_ I had to describe work I do now I'd say: I study in the school of Population and Public Health. I am researching social determinants of health, essentially I am researching how all things that are not "health" itself (e.g., Access to green or blue spaces, transportation, educational background) impact people's health.
