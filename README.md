*Class Prompt:* What kind of scientist do you tell people you are at dinner parties?

*Response:* Honestly, I don't call myself a scientist yet. I feel that I need to "earn" that name. _If_ I had to describe work I do now and would like to do in the future, I would like to become something akin to a "Biostatistician" or an "Epidemiologist", "Data Scientist" would be nice.
